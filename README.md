## Description
 - GERTY is a Virtual Assistant that helps you find information quickly. Be it current weather,

 -  GERTY is powered by:
    1. OMDB API
    2. News API
    3. Weather API
    4. Quotes API
    5. Giphy API

## Approach

- My aim for this project to learn How to use API's and build something useful that i can use in future.
- Use rails for a decent app.
- I am building API's that consumes other API's.

1. Designed the website from wireframe.
2. Created trello app with designed card task. eg: Todo list, doing, done, Feature and Aim.
3. Made a list of API's that i want to work with.
4. Created ruby on rails app.
5. Created database to store history search.
6. Generated models, controller and action.
7. Got JSON data from the API's.
8. Used HTTParty gem and fetch function to talk with API's
9. Using the API's JSON data, created web pages using ruby.
10. Made frequent commits.
11. Error handling and avoiding empty input not to save in db.

## Difficult Obstacles

1. Talking with API's and working with different API's
2. Learning new concept - About Modules.
3. learning to use link_to tag functionality
4. to make the all the query of API's to be used in a single page and display in home page.
5. finding out - query's that match with "giphy" as action "rainbow cat" as query_req.
